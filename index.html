                Being able to say that you created a website is something that is really cool and interesting. 
                Being able to create my own website was something that drew me in and captivated me, which led to me teaching myself web development. 
                However, when I was starring on this journey, I had no clue of where to start and what anything meant. 
                This webpage is not meant to be a guide on how to do everything in web development, or even where to start but it does have some courses and roadmaps attached at the bottom. 
                This webpage is here to show how the CSS display properties work, as it was something that I have continuously had trouble with as I learned on my own.

            <h2>What is HTML and CSS?</h2>
            <p>
                As a whole, web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications. 
                Before we dive into the display properties of CSS, we need to know what HTML and CSS are. 
                Web development uses the combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create websites, style the websites, and give the websites functionality. 
                The process uses HTML to create the framework of the website, CSS to style and shape the website, and it uses JavaScript to dynamically update and change the website. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and is used as the structure, or the foundations of the website, placing all the items and building blocks on the page. 
                It uses different tags such as <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> to display headers, paragraphs, images, and containers. 
                HTML uses these elements to create the skeleton of the website, but it does not dictate the layout or how the content is displayed at all.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and is used to control the design and the layout of the website. 
                CSS can be used to change properties on direct elements of HTML or it can use the ids and the classes from HTML. 
                In HTML, an element can be given a class or an Id, and the classes given to elements can also be called in CSS. 
                CSS can be applied to a HTML page in two ways, by embedding the CSS directly in the HTML with a style tag, or by linking an external style sheet. 
                CSS also allows for making the website more appealing and responsive through different screen sizes. 
                JavaScript is used to dynamically change the values in both HTML and CSS, but I will not be going over it on this website.

            <h2>CSS Layout formatting</h2>
            <p>
                When it comes to using CSS to structure the layout of an HTML page, there are three common properties that are extremely useful. 
                These three properties are the display property, the position property, and the margin and padding properties. 
            </p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h3>CSS Margins and Padding</h3>
            <p>
                The margin property is used to set the margins of an object, or the space outside of an object, and the padding property is used to give an object extra space inside of the object. 
                An example is given below:
            </p>
            <div class="flex-container">
                <div class="container">
                    <div class="square">1</div>
                </div>

                <div class="container">
                    <div class="square extra-margin">2</div>
                </div>

                <div class="container">
                    <div class="square extra-padding">3</div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                In the above examples, box 1 has no extra margin or padding, and is hugging the left wall. 
                Box 2 is given extra margins, and therefore is given extra space outside of itself, placing itself closer to the center.       
                Box three is given extra left padding, which gives extra space to the inside of the object, as seen with box three and its extended left side.
            </p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h3>CSS Position Property</h3>
            <aside>
                <p>
                    An example of an object with the fixed display is the Navigation Bar at the top of this website. 
                    Notice how the Nav bar stays 'fixed' at the top of the page.
                </p>
            </aside>
            <p>
                The next property is the position property. 
                This property controls how elements are set on the page, with values such as <code>fixed</code>, <code>static</code>, <code>absolute</code>, and <code>relative</code>. 
                The most commonly used are the <code>absolute</code>, <code>fixed</code>, and the <code>relative</code> values, which position the object in the absolute space, fixed on the screen, or relative to other objects respectively. 
                Below are some examples of how these properties work.
            </p>
            
            <div class="demo">
                <h3>CSS Position Demo</h3>
                <div class="choices">
                    <button type="button" onclick="positionStatic()"><code>position: static;</code></button>
                    <button type="button" onclick="positionAbsolute()"><code>position: absolute;</code></button>
                    <button type="button" onclick="positionRelative()"><code>position: relative;</code></button>
                    <button type="button" onclick="positionFixed()"><code>position: fixed;</code></button>
                </div>
                <div class="output-container">
                    <div class="output position-output">
                        <div class="box">1</div>
                        <div id="position-box" class="box">2</div>
                        <div class="box">3</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                Given the demo above, the four buttons give the box labeled '2' different position values.
                The first button, <code>position: static;</code>, sets the position to static, which is the default value. When a object is static, it is positioned according to the normal flow of the page. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The next button, <code>position: absolute;</code>, sets the position of the object to an absolute position in its container. 
                This means that the position of the object is dictated by other CSS properties called inset properties. 
                These inset properties come in the form of <code>top</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>bottom</code>, and <code>right</code>, allowing these values to be manually set.
                The code for the <code>position: absolute;</code> sets <code>top</code> and <code>left</code> to <code>'40px'</code>, meaning they are inset by 40 pixels in the container outlined by the orange border.
                When an object is set to absolute, the other objects nearby do not count it as a physical position, and it is seen that box three takes the spot that box 2 was in due to this.
            </p>
            <p>
                The third button, <code>position: relative;</code>, sets the position to be relative to the other objects it is around. 
                Using the inset values, an object with the position value of <code>relative</code> can be moved relative to its surrounding objects.
                In this example, the code gives box 2 an inset <code>left</code> value of <code>'100px'</code>, meaning it is set 100 pixels left of its original position.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last button, <code>position: fixed;</code>, sets the position of the object to a fixed position on the page. 
                Once this is done, the object does not move while the page is scrolled but stays at the location applied to it.
                Box 2 was given the inset <code>top</code> and <code>left</code> values of <code>'400px'</code>, meaning that it is fixed in place at 400 pixels from the top and 400 pixels from the left of the page.
            </p>

            <h3>CSS Display Property</h3>
            <p>
                The last property is the display property. 
                This property determines how an element behaves in a layout. 
                This property has many uses and can be applied to both the element itself and the children (sub-elements) of an element. 
                The most commonly used values of display are <code>block</code> and <code>inline</code> which determine whether an element will take up the full width of their container or just as much as they need, and the values <code>flex</code> and <code>grid</code> which are extremely useful for setting more complex statements. 
                Below is an interactive piece that allows you to test how these properties work.
            </p>
            <div class="demo display-demo">
                <h3>CSS Display Demo</h3>
                <div class="choices">
                    <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('outline').style.display = 'block' "><code>display: block;</code></button>
                    <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('outline').style.display = 'inline-block' "><code>display: inline-block;</code></button>
                    <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('outline').style.display = 'flex' "><code>display: flex;</code></button>
                    <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('outline').style.display = 'grid' "><code>display: grid;</code></button>
                    <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('outline').style.display = 'none' "><code>display: none;</code></button>
                </div>
                <div class="output-container display-output">
                    <div class="output">
                        Some text A
                        <div id="outline" class="output-outline">
                            <div id="display-box" class="box">1</div>
                            <div id="display-box" class="box">2</div>
                            <div id="display-box" class="box">3</div>
                        </div>
                        Some text B
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                Given the demo above, there are 5 different display values that can be applied to the container for the three boxes.
                When the values are applied, they are not applied to the individual boxes but rather the container that the boxes are in. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The first button, <code>display: block;</code>, is a property that is applied to the container itself, not the contents of the container. 
                This property makes the object it is applied to always start a new line and take up the full width available.
                In the example, it is seen that the container separates itself from the two lines of text and takes the full width available to it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The second button, <code>display: inline-block;</code>, is an <code>inline</code> property, meaning that the objects it is applied to do not start a new line and only takes up as much space as needed.
                Since it is also an <code>block</code> property, it can still have width and height values applied to it, however that is not shown in this example.
                In the example, the container is seen shrinking to the exact size of the three boxes, only taking up the necessary space. 
                It is also seen being in line with the lines of text, not creating line breaks.
            </p>
            <p>
                The third button, <code>display: flex;</code>, sets the property to <code>flex</code> which is short for flexible. 
                The flexible property allows for a lot of different options, and comes with 7 other CSS properties.
                The <code>flexbox</code> property is mainly used for 1-dimensional layouts, where there are either rows OR columns, not both.
                For more information on FlexBox, <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Flexbox" id="actual_link">Click Here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fourth button, <code>display: grid;</code>, is similar to the flex property but sets the object to <code>grid</code> instead.
                The grid layout is a two-dimensional layout that is used to create grids with both rows AND columns. 
                In order to set the rows and columns, the <code>grid</code> layout uses a property call <code>grid-template-columns</code> to set the number of columns and how wide each column is.
                For more information on CSS grid layout, <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Grids" id="actual_link">Click Here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final button, <code>display: none;</code>, sets the display property of the object to none.
                This makes the object not be displayed, and if the object is a container then nothing inside of the it will be displayed either.
                This is shown when clicked in the demo as the container shown by the orange border disappears along with the boxes inside.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="last">
            In conclusion, CSS offers numerous ways to direct the layout of a webpage as you like. 
            Properties such as <code>display</code>, <code>position</code>, and the <code>margin</code> and <code>padding</code> properties are some of the most influential and fundamental properties needed to create a visually appealing layout.
            The <code>margin</code> and <code>padding</code> properties are great for adjusting how an object or a container sits on the page, giving it extra space or even centering a container on the page with <code>margin: auto;</code>.
            The <code>display</code> properties and values are wonderful for setting the behavior of an object, and how objects are arranged on the page.
            Lastly, the <code>position</code> property and values allow for precise placement of object in relation to other objects or just the webpage itself.
            Overall, learning these CSS options for setting the layout of a webpage will definitely help make you a better designer.
